# LITHIUM-CHEMICAL-CODE
Models the chemical interaction between lithium and water 

- **Symbol**: _Li_  
- **Atomic Number** : 3
- **Atomic Weight** : 6.94 u

## Description
Lithium is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. It is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. 
Lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and it must be stored in mineral oil to prevent it from reacting with moisture in the air. 
In its pure form, lithium is used in heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

## Occurrence
Lithium does not occur freely in nature but is found in nearly all igneous rocks and in mineral springs. It is most commonly extracted from spodumene, petalite, and lepidolite.

## Applications
Lithium has a wide range of applications:
- **Batteries**: Lithium is crucial for the production of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which power smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles.
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Lithium compounds are used in psychiatry for the treatment of bipolar disorder.
- **Alloys**: Lithium is used to make lightweight and strong aluminum-lithium alloys for aircraft.
- **Breeder**: Lithium is typically the leading candidate for tritium breeding in most fusion thermonuclear power plant designs

## Safety
Lithium is corrosive and can cause severe burns. It reacts violently with water, releasing hydrogen gas and forming a highly alkaline solution. It also react with air and hydrogen isotops. Proper precautions should be taken when handling lithium, including wearing protective equipment and avoiding contact with water.
